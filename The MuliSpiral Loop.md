Holistic Management of Planned
Intensive Grassing, involves
moving livestock daily. Kit

To save farmers time while 
moving Cows and Chickens,
I've designed a farming layout 
called "The MultiSpiral Loop"

The MultiSpiral Loop consists
of pairs of spiral paddocks.
The first half of each pair,
spiral inward to the centre,
the second half of each pair,
spirals outward from the centre.

The beginnings of each half,
loop together such that each
pair of spirals forms an 
endless looping paddock.

The dark green spirals could consist
of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_oldhamii">Bamboo</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera">Moringa</a> forest which would
form hedgerows as a fence and
habitat for birds and animals,
the brown spirals are roads each side of
forrest.
