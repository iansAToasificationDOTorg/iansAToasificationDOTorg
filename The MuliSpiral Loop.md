Holistic Management of Planned
Intensive Grassing, involves
moving livestock as often as
twice daily.

To save farmers time while 
moving Cows and Chickens,
we have designed a multi-spiral 
layout.

The MultiSpiral Loop consists
of pairs of spiral paddocks.
The first half of each pair,
spiral inward to the centre,
the second half of each pair,
spirals outward from the centre.

The beginnings of each half,
loop together such that each
pair of spirals forms an 
endless looping paddock.

The dark green spirals could consist
of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_oldhamii">Bamboo</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera">Moringa</a> forest which would
form hedgerows as a fence and
habitat for birds and animals,
the brown spirals are roads each side of
forrest.

This MultiSpiral paddock
provides 100 days of grassing per cycle.
Each day paddock is a quarter acre
or 1 Decare. 20 metres wide by 50 metres long.
100 Decare is 10 hectares or 25 acres.
