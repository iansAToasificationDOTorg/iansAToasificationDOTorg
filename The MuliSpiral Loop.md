Holistic Management of Planned
Intensive Grassing, involves
moving livestock daily.

To save farmers time while 
moving Cows and Chickens,
I've designed a farming layout 
called "The Muli-Spiral Loop"

The MultiSpiral Loop consists
of pairs of spiral paddocks.
The first half of each pair,
spiral inward to the centre,
the second half of each pair,
spirals outward from the centre,
The beginnings of each half,
loop together such that each
pair of spirals forms an 
endless looping paddock.

Example of single spiral pair.
