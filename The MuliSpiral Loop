Holistically Management of
Planned Intensive Grassing,
involves moving livestock daily.

To save farmers time 
while daily moving Cows and Chickens,
I've designed a farming layout called
"The Muli-Spiral Loop"

The MultiSpiral Loop consists of many
pairs of spiral paddocks.
The first half of each pair,
spiral inward to the centre,
the second half of each pair,
spirals outward from the centre,
The beginnings of each half, loop
together such that each pair of
spirals form
an endless looping paddock
