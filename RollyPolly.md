RollyPolly

RollyPolly is an electric
fence, post system.

The fence posts roll, so the
farmer doesn't have to 
remove and reinstall posts
from the ground when moving
the electric fence.

Just pull the electric fence
wire each end and the posts 
roll through the long grass.

This greatly reduces time to
move an electric fence.

Gallagher make a similar post
system they called <a

target="_new">TumbleWheel</a>

RollyPolly is based on the

Gallagher TumbleWheel but 
RollyPolly has no plastic parts
and can be maintained by 
the farmer without need to buy
parts off farm
