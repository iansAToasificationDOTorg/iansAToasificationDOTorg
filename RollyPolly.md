RollyPolly

RollyPolly is an electric
fence, post system.

The fence posts roll, so the
farmer doesn't have to 
remove and reinstall posts
from the ground when moving
the electric fence.

Just pull the electric fence
wire each end and the posts 
roll through the long grass.

This greatly reduces time to
move an electric fence.

Gallagher make a similar 
post system they called

target="_new">TumbleWheel</a>

RollyPolly is based on the
Gallagher TumbleWheel but 
RollyPolly has no plastic
parts and can be maintained
by farmers without need to 
buy parts off farm.

To discourage cows from 
scratching on spokes that 
are up off the ground,
RollyPolly uses an
electrified guard.
All posts are grounded
and the axle is insulated
by synthetic rope which 
doubles as the suspension
method off the guard,
which also manages fence
tension & electric charge.
